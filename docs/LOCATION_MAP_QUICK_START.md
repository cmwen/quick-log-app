## Tips

💡 **Use date filters** to focus on specific trips or time periods

💡 **Export after trips** to create travel journals automatically

💡 **Combine with tags** for better LLM insights (e.g., "work", "vacation")

💡 **Timeline view** is great for remembering what you did when

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Map is blank?**
- Check internet connection (needed for map tiles)
- Ensure location permissions are granted
- Make sure you have logged entries with location data

**Q: Some locations missing?**
- Check if a date filter is active
- Entries without coordinates won't show on map
- Clear filter to see all entries

**Q: Can't see location labels?**
- Some entries may only have coordinates
- This happens if geocoding wasn't available
- Tap marker to see coordinates
