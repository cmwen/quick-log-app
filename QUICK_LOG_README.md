5. **Simplicity** - Clean, minimal UI focused on the essentials

## 🔒 Privacy & Permissions

  - Can be disabled in Settings (toggle on/off)
  - Can be denied at OS level; app will work without location tracking
  - Location data never leaves your device
  - Default: Enabled (can be changed anytime)

### Data Storage

- All data stored locally in SQLite database
- No cloud sync or external servers
- No analytics or tracking
- No account or login required
